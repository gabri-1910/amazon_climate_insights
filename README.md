# 🌎 Amazon Climate Insights  
### Understanding 50 Years of Climate Change in the Heart of the Amazon

**Author:** Gabriel da Silva  
**Location:** São Félix do Xingu, Pará, Brazil  
**Project Type:** Data Analytics / Environmental Insights  
**Tools:** Python · Pandas · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Plotly · Streamlit  

---

## 📖 Overview

The Amazon region has faced visible changes in recent decades — rising temperatures, altered rainfall patterns, and shifting river levels.  
This project analyzes **historical climate data from 1972 to 2025** to uncover how these variables have evolved in the southeastern Amazon, focusing primarily on **São Félix do Xingu (PA)**.

By combining temperature, humidity, rainfall, and river-level data from public sources, this study aims to provide a **clear and data-driven view** of the Amazon’s environmental transformations and their potential impact on local communities.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Collect and clean** public datasets from official sources (INMET and ANA).  
2. **Analyze** long-term trends in temperature, rainfall, and river levels.  
3. **Visualize** the relationship between these variables through interactive dashboards.  
4. **Highlight** years of extreme events (droughts, heat waves, or floods).  
5. **Communicate findings** in a clear and visual format accessible to everyone.

## 📊 Example Insights (to be developed)

- 📈 **Temperature Trend:** Average annual temperature in São Félix do Xingu increased by X°C since 1972.  
- 🌧️ **Rainfall Change:** The number of rainy days per year has decreased by X%.  
- 🌊 **River Correlation:** River levels show a clear relationship with rainfall and deforestation periods.  

*(These insights will be updated as the analysis progresses.)*
